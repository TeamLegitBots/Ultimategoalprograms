# Welcome to Team Legitbot's Autonomous Code

There are 3 versions of our code, Auto V1,V2, and V3

## AutoV1
Our first autonomous code developed during the end of 2020 in December. We used three odometry pods on the robot to code movement on the robot. We also started using OpenCV to 
scan the ring's starter stack. It wasn't that accurate but was good enough for the start of the season.

## AutoV2
The second version of autonomous designed for our first qualifer. We implemented a pathfinding program for more accurate movement,(Roadrunner) and are still using object detection. This version is slower and less accurate than V3.

## AutoV3
The third and last autonomous code developed for our second qualifier. Most of this version is quite similar to AutoV2 except movement is much faster and more accurate.

We used roadrunner to help us code our robot for more precise movement. Here are some links which we used:

#### OpenCV
We mainly used Easyopencv to detect the starter stack. Credit to Wizards.exe for making the code.
