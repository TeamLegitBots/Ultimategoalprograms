#Welcome to Team Legitbot's Autonomous Code

There are 3 versions of our code, Auto V1,V2, and V3

##AutoV1
Our first autonomous Code developed during the end of 2020 in December. We used three odometry pods on the robot to code movement on the robot. We also started using OpenCV to 
scan the ring's starter stack.
