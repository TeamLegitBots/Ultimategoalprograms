## Teleop
Welcome to the teleop section of our git hub repository. Here we have two different types of code: Teleop (2 players) and Teleop1p.

### TeleopOneP
TeleopOneP was designed so that one person can control the robot. It is ideal for testing out new robot attachments and parts. 
### Teleop (2 players)
This was made for the actual competitions; one person would be controlling the drive train and the other would control the shooter, intake, and wobble goal arm. In addition to this, Teleop 2p had a unique function, it was able to something we call autoaim. On any place in the field, the robot is able to go to its shooting position by the use of odometry wheels and pathfinding programs. We also were able to do the same thing for the powershots: the robot would automatically shoot rings onto the powershots relatively quickly.
