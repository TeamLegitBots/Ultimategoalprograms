# Ultimategoalprograms
This is Team Legitbots' official Github repo where we share all our code that we've worked in during the 2020-2021 FTC Ultimate Game Season
## Code
Code is organized in different folders with their own readme. Look for them to get a deep dive on what we've done
### Autonomous
The Autnomous folder has all our autonomous code over the season. This is pre-programmed code where the robot does tasks by itself
### Teleop
The Teleop folder has all our dedicated teleop code over the season. This is code dedicated for driving the robot
